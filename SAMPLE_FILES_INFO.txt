Sample PDF Files for Testing:

To test the PDF Table Extractor, you can use any PDF file that contains tables.
Here are some suggestions for finding sample PDFs:

1. Financial Reports (annual reports, quarterly reports)
2. Research Papers with data tables
3. Government documents with statistical tables
4. Business reports with performance metrics
5. Academic papers with experimental results

You can find sample PDFs from:
- Company websites (investor relations sections)
- Government websites (statistics and reports)
- Academic repositories
- Research paper databases

Place your PDF files in the project directory and run:
python example_usage.py

Or use the web interface by running:
python run.py
Then visit: http://localhost:5000
